## Extraction, Ordering, and Tokenization of Scientific Manuscripts

Python tool for extraction, ordering, and tokenization of scientific manuscripts using The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus [S2ORC](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc) manuscripts database and [mat2vec](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec?tab=readme-ov-file#thermoelectric-data). Full text manuscripts can be selected and extracted according to S2ORC metadata tags and stored in a corpus text file, one manuscript per line of a file, ready for training with a Word2vec-type model.
