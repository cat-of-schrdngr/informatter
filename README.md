## Extraction, Ordering, and Tokenization of Scientific Manuscripts

Python tool for extraction, ordering, and tokenization of scientific manuscripts using The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus [S2ORC](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc) manuscripts database and [mat2vec](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec?tab=readme-ov-file#thermoelectric-data). Selected manuscripts are unzipped and extracted from the S2ORC database and stored in a corpus text file, one manuscript per line of a file, which is ready for training with the Word2vec model.
