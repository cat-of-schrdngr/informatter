two recent_publications have elegantly demonstrated the enhancement of solar energy production by TTA photon_upconversion
<nUm> <nUm> laser powered TTA photon_upconversion was used to facilitate WO <nUm> catalyzed water_splitting as well as for enhancing the efficiency of a hydrogenated_amorphous_silicon solar_cell
this was carried_out by co-locating a freeze pumped cuvette containing the TTA photon_upconversion material with the respective photo reaction
here for the rst time we_demonstrate TTA photon_upconversion facilitated production of a solar fuel using non-coherent truncated white_light
this is achieved by using a microuidic device having a large illuminated area approximately <nUm> mm <nUm> and the ability of the TTA photon_upconversion material to facilitate solar fuel production is demonstrated over several_hours
A molecular solar thermal energy_storage system was used as the solar fuel
this kind of molecular system stores the solar energy in chemical_bonds and has_been proposed as a solution to the intermittency issues with solar_energy_harvesting
<nUm> the molecular solar thermal system used in this_study is a fulvalene diruthenium FvRu <nUm> derivative fig. <nUm>
<nUm> upon_exposure to light it isomerizes to a high energy photoisomer capable of long time energy_storage and on demand energy delivery
<nUm> <nUm> the lowest_lying absorption band of FvRu <nUm> is centered close to <nUm> nm and tails into the visible_region of the solar spectrum whereas the high energy photoisomer does_not absorb in the visible_wavelength range at all securing selective excitation of the low energy isomer
we will show that the absorption of the solar fuel is effectively extended into the 500-550 nm wavelength region by employing TTA photon_upconversion
the upconversion system used consists of palladium(II)-octaethylporphyrin PdOEP which absorbs in the 500-550 nm region and 9,10-diphenylanthracene DPA which has a uo rescence spectrum that spectrally matches the absorption_spectrum of the solar fuel fig. <nUm> ).
this is a well studied TTA photon_upconversion system that has an external_quantum upconversion efficiency exceeding <nUm> and it works as follows <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> aer photoexcitation of the porphyrin it quickly relaxes to the lowest_lying triplet_state with high quantum_efficiency
while in the triplet_state the porphyrin collides with and transfers its triplet energy to the anthracene
two anthracenes both in their triplet_state then upon collision undergo triplet triplet annihilation in which one relaxes to the ground_state and the other gains energy to an excited_singlet_state capable of emitting one high energy photon
there is a possible shortcut to this high energy uorescence through back sensitization of the PdOEP singlet_excited_state
<nUm> two mechanisms might_be operative non-radiative_energy transfer FRET and radiative trivial energy_transfer
the former is close to negligible at the PdOEP concentration used in this experiment <nUm> mM see ESI † and the latter is minimized through the use of very short optical path_lengths
nevertheless as can_be seen in fig. <nUm> the DPA uorescence spectrum is slightly_distorted in the blue edge where it overlaps with the red edge of the porphyrin soret_band
this reabsorption of the upconverted light does_not severely hamper the function of the device and has therefore not_been considered quantitatively in the analysis
In order to use the upconverted photons from the PdOEP DPA system to facilitate the energy conversion of the solar fuel a microuidic device was constructed
the device functions as a ow reactor for continuous harvesting of solar energy and is made up of two identical custom_made microuidic fused_silica chips litcon
the chips contain a <nUm> mm deep and <nUm> mm wide winding channel forming a total irradiated area of <nUm> mm <nUm> and an internal volume of <nUm> ml
the two glass chips are placed on top of each_other with the solar fuel being pumped through the top one and the TTA photon_upconversion uid owing through the lower chip fig. <nUm>
A syringe_pump was used to control the ow speed of the solar fuel dissolved in toluene-d <nUm> whereas the TTA photon_upconversion system dissolved in toluene was aer careful deaeration by argon owed through the chip by the aid of journal of materials chemistry A communication gravity
to ensure that argon bubbling creates a sufficiently deaerated environment for the upconversion process to occur a control experiment in a spectrouorometer was performed
aer argon bubbling the upconversion uid was transferred by a similar tubing system to that used in the device to a cuvette and the upconversion_quantum_yield was determined to be <nUm> which is in good_agreement with the reported value of <nUm>
<nUm> At moderate light intensities the upconversion_quantum_yield is dependent on both light_intensity and concentration meaning that the quantum_yield will not be exactly_the_same in the device as in this control experiment
however the control experiment shows that the deareating and transferring methods used are sufficiently sophisticated to allow the upconversion process to occur
In the experimental device setup a <nUm> W metal_halide_lamp was used to deliver white_light having a color temperature of <nUm> K osram powerstar HQI-R
the irradiated device was immersed in a water bath <nUm> C to keep it at a constant temperature throughout the course of the experiment
aer reaching the device the light from the lamp rst passed_through a glass lter cut-on wavelength ¼ <nUm> nm newport which removed most of the high energy photons capable of direct excitation of the solar fuel
the truncated light then passed_through the chip containing the solar fuel to reach the chip containing the TTA upconversion material there being absorbed upconverted and reemitted to enhance the solar fuel production
In fig. <nUm> the photochemical conversion of the low energy FvRu <nUm> isomer to the high energy photoisomer as a function of residence_time in the ow reactor in the presence and absence of TTA photon_upconversion is shown
At the very low conversions observed in this experiment the extent of reaction varies close to linearly with the residence_time
the enhancement of the solar fuel production by the TTA upconversion system is <nUm>
this enhancement is due to the light in the 500-550 nm wavelength range not being absorbed by the solar fuel but instead by PdOEP upconverted and reemitted in the 400-500 nm wavelength range which is the light that the solar fuel is capable_of_absorbing
In the ow reactor FvRu <nUm> is dissolved in toluene-d <nUm> and the photochemical conversion is monitored by NMR without further sample preparation from the uid exiting the ow reactor
this requires an accumulated volume of <nUm> ml
thus each data point in fig. <nUm> showing the photochemical conversion as a function of residence_time in the ow reactor is the average result of <nUm> reactor volumes which equals to <nUm> <nUm> h depending on the ow speed
the data points are taken in random order and no fouling of the channels could_be observed by the naked_eye aer the complete dataset was acquired showing at least on a lab_scale the high stability of the system
A closer_examination of fig. <nUm> reveals that the data points having a longer_residence_time are slightly biased to lower photochemical conversion than those having a shorter_residence_time
this is true both in the presence and absence of TTA photon_upconversion indicating that this phenomenon is not related to the upconversion as such but rather to the stability of the photoisomer
the photoisomer is sensitive to molecular oxygen and the longer_residence_time requires a longer storage time from photoconversion to analysis during which some oxygen might_have reacted with the photoproduct
from an application point_of_view this tendency of degradation by molecular oxygen should_not be a major problem since this kind of solar fuel is intended to work in a closed cycle with no oxygen contact
In summary we_have shown for the rst time that non-coherent light can_be used to drive a TTA photon_upconversion process which_in_turn is used to facilitate a solar_energy_harvesting reaction
this has_been achieved by locating upconversion materials and a molecular solar thermal system on top of each_other in a microuidic device working as a ow reactor having an irradiated surface_area of <nUm> mm <nUm>
the setup is stable in the sense that the solar fuel production scales with the residence_time of the reactor and that no fouling in the microuidic channels even aer <nUm> h of run time could_be observed
when considering practical_applications one limiting_factor in the used FvRu <nUm> system is the quantum_yield of photochemical conversion of <nUm> in toluene
for efficient and practical_applications new MOST systems with near_unity quantum_yield are preferred
<nUm> we_believe_that employing TTA photon_upconversion will_become a general straightforward and economically_feasible method to supersede the shockley and queisser limit of solar light_harvesting devices in the course of time
In this regard the development of more_efficient TTA-UC systems operating under natural solar irradiation conditions is highly_desirable

<nUm> upon_exposure to light it isomerizes to a high energy photoisomer capable of long time energy_storage and on demand energy delivery
<nUm> <nUm> the lowest_lying absorption band of FvRu <nUm> is centered close to <nUm> nm and tails into the visible_region of the solar spectrum whereas the high energy photoisomer does_not absorb in the visible_wavelength range at all securing selective excitation of the low energy isomer
we will show that the absorption of the solar fuel is effectively extended into the 500-550 nm wavelength region by employing TTA photon_upconversion
the upconversion system used consists of palladium(II)-octaethylporphyrin PdOEP which absorbs in the 500-550 nm region and 9,10-diphenylanthracene DPA which has a uo rescence spectrum that spectrally matches the absorption_spectrum of the solar fuel fig. <nUm> ).
this is a well studied TTA photon_upconversion system that has an external_quantum upconversion efficiency exceeding <nUm> and it works as follows <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> aer photoexcitation of the porphyrin it quickly relaxes to the lowest_lying triplet_state with high quantum_efficiency
while in the triplet_state the porphyrin collides with and transfers its triplet energy to the anthracene
two anthracenes both in their triplet_state then upon collision undergo triplet triplet annihilation in which one relaxes to the ground_state and the other gains energy to an excited_singlet_state capable of emitting one high energy photon
there is a possible shortcut to this high energy uorescence through back sensitization of the PdOEP singlet_excited_state
<nUm> two mechanisms might_be operative non-radiative_energy transfer FRET and radiative trivial energy_transfer
the former is close to negligible at the PdOEP concentration used in this experiment <nUm> mM see ESI † and the latter is minimized through the use of very short optical path_lengths
nevertheless as can_be seen in fig. <nUm> the DPA uorescence spectrum is slightly_distorted in the blue edge where it overlaps with the red edge of the porphyrin soret_band
this reabsorption of the upconverted light does_not severely hamper the function of the device and has therefore not_been considered quantitatively in the analysis
In order to use the upconverted photons from the PdOEP DPA system to facilitate the energy conversion of the solar fuel a microuidic device was constructed
the device functions as a ow reactor for continuous harvesting of solar energy and is made up of two identical custom_made microuidic fused_silica chips litcon
the chips contain a <nUm> mm deep and <nUm> mm wide winding channel forming a total irradiated area of <nUm> mm <nUm> and an internal volume of <nUm> ml
the two glass chips are placed on top of each_other with the solar fuel being pumped through the top one and the TTA photon_upconversion uid owing through the lower chip fig. <nUm>
A syringe_pump was used to control the ow speed of the solar fuel dissolved in toluene-d <nUm> whereas the TTA photon_upconversion system dissolved in toluene was aer careful deaeration by argon owed through the chip by the aid of journal of materials chemistry A communication gravity
to ensure that argon bubbling creates a sufficiently deaerated environment for the upconversion process to occur a control experiment in a spectrouorometer was performed
aer argon bubbling the upconversion uid was transferred by a similar tubing system to that used in the device to a cuvette and the upconversion_quantum_yield was determined to be <nUm> which is in good_agreement with the reported value of <nUm>
<nUm> At moderate light intensities the upconversion_quantum_yield is dependent on both light_intensity and concentration meaning that the quantum_yield will not be exactly_the_same in the device as in this control experiment
however the control experiment shows that the deareating and transferring methods used are sufficiently sophisticated to allow the upconversion process to occur
In the experimental device setup a <nUm> W metal_halide_lamp was used to deliver white_light having a color temperature of <nUm> K osram powerstar HQI-R
the irradiated device was immersed in a water bath <nUm> C to keep it at a constant temperature throughout the course of the experiment
aer reaching the device the light from the lamp rst passed_through a glass lter cut-on wavelength ¼ <nUm> nm newport which removed most of the high energy photons capable of direct excitation of the solar fuel
the truncated light then passed_through the chip containing the solar fuel to reach the chip containing the TTA upconversion material there being absorbed upconverted and reemitted to enhance the solar fuel production
In fig. <nUm> the photochemical conversion of the low energy FvRu <nUm> isomer to the high energy photoisomer as a function of residence_time in the ow reactor in the presence and absence of TTA photon_upconversion is shown
At the very low conversions observed in this experiment the extent of reaction varies close to linearly with the residence_time
the enhancement of the solar fuel production by the TTA upconversion system is <nUm>
this enhancement is due to the light in the 500-550 nm wavelength range not being absorbed by the solar fuel but instead by PdOEP upconverted and reemitted in the 400-500 nm wavelength range which is the light that the solar fuel is capable_of_absorbing
In the ow reactor FvRu <nUm> is dissolved in toluene-d <nUm> and the photochemical conversion is monitored by NMR without further sample preparation from the uid exiting the ow reactor
this requires an accumulated volume of <nUm> ml
thus each data point in fig. <nUm> showing the photochemical conversion as a function of residence_time in the ow reactor is the average result of <nUm> reactor volumes which equals to <nUm> <nUm> h depending on the ow speed
the data points are taken in random order and no fouling of the channels could_be observed by the naked_eye aer the complete dataset was acquired showing at least on a lab_scale the high stability of the system
A closer_examination of fig. <nUm> reveals that the data points having a longer_residence_time are slightly biased to lower photochemical conversion than those having a shorter_residence_time
this is true both in the presence and absence of TTA photon_upconversion indicating that this phenomenon is not related to the upconversion as such but rather to the stability of the photoisomer
the photoisomer is sensitive to molecular oxygen and the longer_residence_time requires a longer storage time from photoconversion to analysis during which some oxygen might_have reacted with the photoproduct
from an application point_of_view this tendency of degradation by molecular oxygen should_not be a major problem since this kind of solar fuel is intended to work in a closed cycle with no oxygen contact
In summary we_have shown for the rst time that non-coherent light can_be used to drive a TTA photon_upconversion process which_in_turn is used to facilitate a solar_energy_harvesting reaction
this has_been achieved by locating upconversion materials and a molecular solar thermal system on top of each_other in a microuidic device working as a ow reactor having an irradiated surface_area of <nUm> mm <nUm>
the setup is stable in the sense that the solar fuel production scales with the residence_time of the reactor and that no fouling in the microuidic channels even aer <nUm> h of run time could_be observed
when considering practical_applications one limiting_factor in the used FvRu <nUm> system is the quantum_yield of photochemical conversion of <nUm> in toluene
for efficient and practical_applications new MOST systems with near_unity quantum_yield are preferred
<nUm> we_believe_that employing TTA photon_upconversion will_become a general straightforward and economically_feasible method to supersede the shockley and queisser limit of solar light_harvesting devices in the course of time
In this regard the development of more_efficient TTA-UC systems operating under natural solar irradiation conditions is highly_desirable
