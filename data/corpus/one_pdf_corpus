gene_therapy holds potential for treating many severe diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases
<nUm> successful gene_therapy depends on highefficiency gene_delivery processes in which the gene_carriers have an essential role
the application of traditional viral vectors has_been a challenge because of their toxicity immunogenicity and low capability for scaling up
<nUm> there has long been a scientific demand for developing non-viral_gene delivery_systems that can overcome_the_drawbacks of viral vectors
<nUm> non-viral_gene delivery has_been advanced by the rapid development of materials_science and technology
numerous novel gene_delivery systems have_been proposed based on functional cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine PEI <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl_methacrylate <nUm> poly(L-lysine) <nUm> poly(aspartic acid <nUm> <nUm> and polyamidoamine
<nUm> however these non-viral_gene carriers still have shortcomings including cytotoxicity low transfection_efficiency and lack of multifunction
recently we found that ethanolamine EA or ethylenediamine (ED)-functionalized poly(glycidyl_methacrylate PGMA namely PGEA or PGED could_be used as effective gene_carriers
<nUm> <nUm> they_possess good gene_transfection properties
to further improve the performance of PGMA based gene_carriers several strategies have_been applied such as polysaccharide introduction and target molecule binding
<nUm> <nUm> owing to the dynamically unable ability of supramolecular_polymers the application of supramolecular_chemistry for gene_delivery has_been a hot_research_topic in the biomedical field
<nUm> <nUm> the construction of supramolecular polycations via host guest interaction is a popular strategy for high efficiency gene_delivery systems
<nUm> In particular cyclodextrins CDs and their derivatives have_been widely_utilized for constructing supramolecular gene_delivery systems mainly because of their superior biocompatibility
<nUm> <nUm> <nUm> with the host guest interaction strategy we successfully_prepared one PGEA based supramolecular delivery system by tying multiple b-cyclodextrin (b-CD)cored star PGEA polymers to an adamantine modified linear PGEA backbone
<nUm> such PGEA supramolecules markedly increased transfection efficiencies
further_improvements in functionality and the development of new preparation strategies for PGMA based supramolecular vectors would_benefit the construction of better gene_delivery systems
to construct multifunctional supramolecular vectors a novel strategy was proposed to flexibly prepare PGMA based supramolecular delivery_systems PGED-Gd PGEAs with magnetic_resonance_imaging MRI functionality by assembling multiple adamantine headed star PGEA ad PGEA units with a versatile PGED-CD-Gd backbone scheme <nUm>
this backbone possessed numerous flanking b-CD species and Gd 3+ ions
MRI technology has_received considerable_attention_because of its high spatial_resolution and its applications in areas such as deep_tissue imaging
<nUm> <nUm> In particular Gd 3+ ions have_been used as contrast_agents because of their optimal chemical and magnetic properties
<nUm> <nUm> In this_work Gd ions were chelated by diethylenetriaminepentacetate acid DTPA immobilized on the PGED backbones to introduce the MRI effect into the resultant PGED-Gd PGEA supramolecular systems

preparation and characterization of supramolecular polycations with Gd 3+ chelation As shown in scheme <nUm> the PGMA based supramolecular delivery_systems PGED-Gd PGEAs with MRI functions were prepared by assembling multiple ad PGEA units with a PGED-CD-Gd backbone
the PGED-CD-Gd backbone possessed numerous flanking b-CD species and Gd 3+ ions
for the preparation of the PGED-CD-Gd backbone the starting PGMA Mn <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> g mol − <nUm> PDI <nUm> with <nUm> repeat_units was first synthesized_via ATRP
then PGMA was functionalized with excess ED by ring_opening addition to produce PGED with abundant primary_amine_groups
similar to our_previous study <nUm> it was confirmed that the PGED was successfully_prepared from the NMR results supplementary figure s1(a1) ).
to introduce b-CD units CD-EP that possessed one epoxy ring supplementary figure s1(a2) was immobilized_onto PGED via ring_opening figure s1(a3) the molar_ratio of b-CD and ED units was <nUm> <nUm> indicating that every PGED-CD chain contained <nUm> b-CD units
DTPA the chelating_agent of Gd 3+ ions was subsequently_reacted with the remaining primary_amine_groups of PGED-CD via the amidation_reaction producing PGED-CD-DTPA
based on the <nUm> H NMR spectrum of PGED-CD-DTPA supplementary figure s1(a4) PGED-CD-DTPA contained <nUm> DPTA units
the resultant PGED-CD-Gd backbone was obtained by the chelation of PGED-CD-DTPA with Gd 3+ ions
according to the thermogravimetric_analysis supplementary figure S2 the PGED-CD-Gd backbone contained <nUm> Gd 3+ ions which was fairly_consistent with the number of DPTA units
the synthesis of the ad PGEA guest with three arms was performed in a four step procedure scheme <nUm>
C(CH <nUm> OH <nUm> was compounded with 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid chloride and the rest of the hydroxyl_groups were reacted with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide to initiate the ATRP process of GMA followed by ring_opening of epoxy_groups of ad PGMA with excess EA
every step of the preparation process of ad PGEA was monitored by <nUm> H NMR supplementary figure S3 ).
after the first two steps of the substitution reaction C-CH <nUm> -OCO protons and CH <nUm> -C-Br protons from the newly_formed Ad-OH and Ad-Br were observed at <nUm> and <nUm> ppm respectively
by integrating the corresponding NMR peaks it was estimated that Ad-Br possessed approximately three initiation sites
the resultant ad PGMA1 Mn <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> g mol − <nUm> PDI <nUm> and ad PGMA2 Mn <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> g mol − <nUm> PDI <nUm> were prepared by using Ad-Br
the ad PGMA species were further functionalized with excess EA to produce the corresponding ad PGEA1 and ad PGEA2 guests with different_molecular_weights
similar to our_previous_studies <nUm> <nUm> ad PGMA and ad PGEA were successfully_prepared as shown by the NMR results supplementary figure S3 ).
for the preparation of the PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA assemblies two ad PGEA guests were complexed with PGED-CD or PGED-CD-Gd hosts in DI_water by the host guest interaction of ad and CD species
characterization of polymer pDNA nanocomplexes for non-viral polycationic gene_carriers the ability to condense pDNA into a nanoparticle is essential because nanocomplexes of carrier and pDNA are more suitable for cellular_uptake
In this_work agarose_gel_electrophoresis particle_size and z-potential measurements as well as AFM_images were used to confirm the ability of PGMA based polycations to condense pDNA
the gel retardation results of polymer pDNA complexes with increasing N P ratios are shown in figure <nUm>
all PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA could compact pDNA completely within the N P ratio of <nUm> whereas the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and ad PGEA guests only condensed pDNA when N P ratios reached <nUm>
the above results_indicated that the pDNAcondensing ability of PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA is better than that of PGED-CD-Gd and ad PGEA which is probably_because of the high molecular_weight supramolecular_structures
<nUm> the particle_size and the z-potential of polymer pDNA complexes with increasing N P ratio are shown in figure <nUm>
the particle_sizes of all complexes decreased with increasing N P ratios
At lower N P ratios loose aggregates with large size were formed owing to the few positive_charges on the polymers
<nUm> with an increase in the N P ratios the diameters of all complexes decreased to 100-150 nm which enabled the complexes to easily undergo endocytosis
it was also noted that at both low and high N P ratios the polycation pDNA complexes had good stability supplementary figure S4 ).
In addition to particle_sizes the z-potential of polymer pDNA complexes are another factor that affects cellular_uptake
all of the complexes had positive z-potentials and the values of the z-potential slightly increased with the N P ratios
owing to the positive_charges polymer pDNA complexes had a good affinity for the negatively_charged cell membrane and were able to facilitate cellular_uptake
<nUm> the z-potential values of PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA groups were higher than those of the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and ad PGEA guests once_again confirming that PGMA based supramolecular polycations possessed better DNA compacting ability
the morphology of polymer pDNA complexes was observed by AFM
figure <nUm> shows the representative AFM_images of ad PGEA1 pDNA PGED PGEA1 pDNA and PGED-Gd PGEA1 pDNA complexes at the N P ratio of <nUm>
the AFM_images_show that the polymers could compact pDNA to form nanoparticles with a diameter of <nUm> nm which is consistent with the results of particle_size measurement figure 2a ).
low cytotoxicity is essential for ideal biomedical materials
to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PGMA based polycation pDNA complexes at different N P ratios an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium_bromide assay was performed using the C6 and hep_G2 cell lines
the relative cell_viabilities of all of the groups in both cell lines decreased with increasing N P ratios figure <nUm> ).
the cytotoxicity of polycations generally increases with their molecular_weight
<nUm> In comparison with the PGED-CD and PGED-CD-Gd backbone PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA exhibited increased cytotoxicity
however PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA showed significantly lower cytotoxicity than the gold standard PEI <nUm> kDa
for example at an N P ratio of <nUm> for the PGMA based polycation pDNA complexes the relative cell_viability values of C6 cells were <nUm> and those of hep_G2 <nUm>
In our_earlier work <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> it was found that in comparison with PEI which mainly has secondary_amine_groups the nonionic hydrophilic hydroxyl_groups of PGEAs can shield the deleterious excess charges of the cationic complexes leading to lower cytotoxicity
In addition no_significant_differences among the cytotoxicities of ad PGEA PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA were observed
the above results_indicated that the supramolecular_polymers could_achieve a lower cytotoxicity despite their high molecular_weights
the gene_transfection efficiency of the polycation pDNA complexes was first analyzed in C6 and hep_G2 cell lines using pRL CMV as a reporter_gene
the C6 and hep_G2 cell lines are documented to be difficult to transfect with synthetic vectors
<nUm> figure <nUm> shows the gene_transfection efficiencies mediated by ad PGEA PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA at various N P ratios in comparison with those mediated by the controls PEI <nUm> kDa PGED-CD and PGED-CD-Gd at their_respective optimal N P ratios
In general the transfection_efficiency first increases and then decreases slightly with increasing N P ratio
At lower N P ratios cationic polymers can_not efficiently compact DNA and the resultant loose nanocomplexes can_not easily enter cells
by contrast at higher N P ratios the transfection_efficiency slightly_decreased probably as a result of the increased toxicity of free cationic polymers
the difference in gene_transfection efficiencies at the same N P ratio was observed between C6 and hep_G2 cells
the transfection efficiencies of gene_carriers depend on different cell types because of their different properties
<nUm> As expected the transfection efficiencies of PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA were significantly higher than those of ad PGEA guests at various N P ratios because PGED PGEA and In vitro gene_transfection efficiencies of the polymer pDNA complexes at various N P ratios in a C6 and b hep_G2 cells in comparison with those mediated by PEI <nUm> kDa at its optimal N P ratio of <nUm> PGED-CD at the optimal N P ratio of <nUm> for C6 or <nUm> for G2 cells and PGED-CD-Gd at the optimal N P ratio of <nUm> for C6 or <nUm> for hep_G2 cells mean ± s.d. n <nUm> *Po0.05
PGED-Gd PGEA might benefit from the better DNA compacting ability figure <nUm> and low toxicities figure <nUm> of the supramolecular vectors
notably the transfection efficiencies of PGED PGEA and PGED-Gd PGEA arising from the same ad PGEA guests exhibited no_significant_difference indicating that the Gd 3+ ions had_no_obvious effects on transfection efficiencies
In C6 and hep_G2 cell lines ad PGEA2 exhibited_much_higher transfection efficiencies than ad PGEA1
this indicated_that the transfection efficiencies mediated by PGEA based vectors were dependent on the molecular_weight of PGEA
In addition the transfection efficiencies mediated by PGED P-GEA and PGED-Gd PGEA at most N P ratios were much_higher_than_those mediated by PEI at its optimal ratio of <nUm>
As shown in figure <nUm> the differences_between the transfection efficiencies of ad PGEA1 and PGED-Gd PGEA1 at most N P ratios are bigger than those of ad PGEA2 and PGED-Gd PGEA2
thus PGED-Gd PGEA1 was selected as the representative supramolecular vector in the following experiments

Y zhao_et al encoding GFP was used as another reporter_gene in C6 and hep_G2 cell lines
representative images of EGFP gene_expression mediated by ad PGEA1 PGED PGEA1 and PGED-Gd PGEA1 at their_respective optimal N P ratios are shown in figure <nUm>
the corresponding merged images are shown in supplementary figure S5
transfection with PGED PGEA1 or PGED-Gd PGEA1 led to more green EGFPpositive hep_G2 cells than did ad PGEA1 or PEI
the transfection_efficiency as reflected by the percentage of EGFP positive cells was quantitatively determined using flow_cytometry
the percentages of EGFP positive cells for ad PGEA1 PGED PGEA1 PGED-Gd PGEA1 and PEI in C6 or hep_G2 cells are <nUm> or <nUm> <nUm> or <nUm> <nUm> or <nUm> and <nUm> or <nUm> respectively which is fairly_consistent with the results for luciferase expression figure <nUm> ).
the above gene_transfection assay indicated_that the supramolecular structure improved the gene_transfection and Gd 3+ ions had_no_obvious adverse_effects on the transfection process
to investigate the intracellular fates of the supramolecular vectors the C6 and hep_G2 cells were treated with the ad PGEA1 pDNA PGED PGEA1 pDNA and PGED-Gd PGEA1 pDNA complexes for <nUm> h at their_respective optimal N P ratios <nUm> for C6 cells and <nUm> for hep_G2 cells whereas the pDNA was labeled by OY as shown in figure <nUm>
OY labeled pDNA is shown in green
the nuclei stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole are shown in blue
compared with the cells treated with ad PGEA1 pDNA the cells treated with PGED PGEA1 pDNA and PGED-Gd PGEA1 pDNA showed more green aggregations
the corresponding merged images are shown in supplementary figure S6
the cellular_uptake of the complexes with OY labeled pDNA was quantified by flow_cytometry
the percentages of OY positive cells treated with PGED PGEA1 pDNA and PGED-Gd PGEA1 pDNA were almost <nUm> much_higher_than_those <nUm> <nUm> of the cells treated with ad PGEA1 pDNA
this result was consistent with the fluorescent images of cellular_uptake confirming that supramolecular structure enhanced cell uptake benefiting the resultant gene_transfection
the complexes with gadolinium have_been widely_used as efficient t1weighted MR contrast_agents
<nUm> <nUm> PGED-Gd PGEA was expected to act as an MRI_contrast_agent relaxation_times were shown in supplementary table S1 ).
the MRI assay of PGED-Gd PGEA1 is shown in figure <nUm>
A linear curve could_be obtained by plotting the inverse T1 as a function of the molar concentration of Gd 3+ ions figure 8a top
the brightness of the MR images increased with the molar concentration of Gd 3+ ions figure 8a bottom
next the potential to use the PGED-Gd PGEA1 for MRI of cancer_cells was explored
both C6 and hep_G2 cells were treated for <nUm> h with PGED-CD-Gd and PGED-Gd PGEA1 at different Gd 3+ ion concentrations in culture_media <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> mM before imaging with the MR systems
both the inverse T1 and MR images were presented and collected
the MR images of cancer_cells treated with PGED-CD-Gd became slightly brighter with an increasing concentration of Gd 3+ ions supplementary figure S7
however the MR images of cancer_cells treated with PGED-Gd PGEA1 evidently became brighter and the inverse T1 increased with the concentration of Gd 3+ ions figure 8b likely arising from the higher cellular_uptake of PGED-Gd PGEA1 figure <nUm>
the above results_indicated that supramolecular structure could also affect the relaxation_time in vitro
PGED-Gd PGEA could_potentially_be used as a contrast_agent for MR_imaging
A series of PGMA based supramolecular polycations PGED-Gd PGEAs with MRI functionality were successfully constructed by assembling multiple ad PGEA guests with a versatile PGED-CD-Gd host which possessed numerous flanking Gd 3+ ions
such PGED-Gd PGEAs had good DNA condensation abilities and low cell cytotoxicity
moreover PGED-Gd PGEAs exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiencies than PEI <nUm> kDa and the constituent units PGED-CD-Gd and ad PGEA
the chelation of Gd 3+ ions imparted PGED-Gd PGEAs with effective MRI functionality without adverse_effects on gene_transfection processes
these unique features could allow PGED-Gd PGEA to become a competitive multifunctional gene_delivery system
